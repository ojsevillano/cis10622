# Week Report 2

## The basics  of Virtualization 
Virtualization has two types of hypervisors, there's type 1 where it runs on the hardware. Then there's type 2, where it runs on a host operating system. Type 1 Example: VMware ESX and ESXi. Type 2 Example: VMware Workstation Player/Pro

Virtualization also has many benefits: 

1. You're able to run multiple operating systems on a single machine
2. You're able to tryout untested programs without giving the host machine a virus or malware

In order to have a good experience using virtualization your computer must have the following specifications:

1. Quad core CPU or Dual core with a base frequency of 2.0GHz
2. 6Gb or more of RAM
3. 60GB or more of Free storage

Definition: Is when you install and run multiple operating systems inside a physical machine

**Types of virtualization:**
